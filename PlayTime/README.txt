Take some time to study the code so far, it shouldnt take too long

I have used one variable name thats different: 

userSex - for this i used "userType"
oppositeUserSex - for this i used "otherUserType" 

The version of android cardview is different. I still dont know why the names are not displayed on the card. 
I think they displaying of info will be done in part 10 (your part) 

The version of URI is also different. So in part 9, there is like 2-3 lines of code different from the tutorial since i had to debug. 

Incase you find any problems, just text me hehe. 

Also these are the users i used for authentication: 

email: rachel@gmail.com, sneha@gmail.com, saksham@gmail.com, saksham@gmail.com 
password:123456

You can check firebase database online for the structure. 
I tested part 9 in rachels account so you can see some more details in the database for her.
